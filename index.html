 <p>Mini Go is the game of 9x9 Go under Chinese rules (komi being 7). Ordinary people can learn to play Mini Go in a few minutes, due to the few simple rules of the game. However, to achieve the lowest master level (1 Dan), it will take at least 5 years if they train five games a day, everyday, or after playing some 10,000 games without serious Go study.</p>

        <p>This is due in part to the 9 x 9 Go board that makes Mini Go comparable to chess in complexity&#8212;the number of paths down the move tree has been estimated to be at 10<sup>120</sup> in chess (Zobrist, 1969), and due in large part to the rules of Go that scarely describe how 9x9 Go is best played.

          <h3><a href="#">5 Tips to Get Better at 9x9 Go</a></h3>
          <span class="category"><a href="#">Learning Methodology</a></span> </div>
        <p>First, knowing Go rules is essential but not enough to make you get better at 9x9 Go. The rules do not describe how Go is best played. They just describe the objects of the game, how Go stones are placed, captured, and made safe, how the game ends, how White's disadvantange of playing second is compensated, and how the final scores are determined. They do not describe how to find the best moves.</p>  
		
		<p>Second, you should develop your skill, by playing thousands of 9x9 Go games online or offline, where there is a stronger opponent. Observe the moves that made you fail and the ones that made you win. Note also that a majority of your moves are not the best ones, and your kyu Go mindset can be a major obstacle that prevents you from breakthrough to Shodan. You will need to unlearn the way to Go, and relearn the better way to 9x9 Go.</p> 
		
		<p>Third, you no longer need to go to human Go masters for instruction. Consult a real Go master, a verified Go AI that has already achieved superhuman performance and topped the chart of a standard online Go server. The verified Go AI should be comparable to KataTest (9 Dan) in superhuman performance&#8212;capable of becoming No. 1 top ranked player on Go Quest.</p> 
		
		<p>Fourth, have your games analyzed by the versified Go AI, for best move detection and correct situation analysis. Do not try to copy the AI moves. Try to make understanding of why the best moves are there, and formulate the principles of 9 x 9 Go to describe and explain the best moves, which can be applied to your games in the future.</p> 
		<p>Fifth, make proverbs to describe the principles of 9 x 9 Go, to remind you how 9x9 Go should be played. The proverbs should be accompanied by diagrams and detailed simple descriptions, or you will forget what your proverbs really mean. If you can't explain the principles of 9x9 Go simply, with your proverbs and the accompanying materials, you don't understand them well enough. The proverbs that cannot be falsified by others will remain reliable proverbs.</p>

          <h3><a href="#">Introduction to A Verified Go AI</a></h3>
          <span class="category"><a href="#">Superhuman AIS &amp; verification</a></span> </div>
        <p>A verified Go AI is a moblie application called A Master of Go, with KataGo engine and the b18nbt neural network that has achieved superhuman performance in 9 x 9 Go. The AI won (2:0) against the old KataGo that topped the charts of human Go servers in 2019, after achieving a 8-Dan ranking on Go Quest, and can predict the next moves of KataTest 9 Dan, with about 95% accuracy. The 5% wrong predictions were the cases where the AI's predicted moves cause higher net scores than the actual moves of KataTest did. The verified AI played at or above 128 visits per move, to be superhuman (Tony et al., 2023)

        <p>Proverbs on 9x9 Go give advice or say something that is generally true about 9x9 Go, or say the principles of 9x9 Go that explains how 9x9 Go is best played, based on the observed strategy and tactics in the winning games of a verified Go AI that has achieve superhuman  performance and can beat other Go AIs that are themselves superhumans. The losing games, due to the adversarial policies or any other causes, were not used for studying, so that the AI's inherent weakness will never affect the proverb quality.
