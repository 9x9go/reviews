 <p>The game of 9 &#215; 9 Go is Go on 9 &#215; 9 board, under Chinese rules (komi being 7). The game is also called 9 Line Go, Mini Go, and Minigo. Ordinary people can learn to play 9 &#215; 9 Go in a few minutes, due to the few simple rules of the game. However, to achieve the lowest master level (1 Dan), it will take at least 5 years if they train five games a day, everyday, or after playing some 10,000 games without serious Go study.</p>

        <p>This is due in part to the 9 &#215; 9 Go board that makes 9 &#215; 9 Go comparable to chess in complexity&#8212;the number of paths down the move tree has been estimated to be at 10<sup>120</sup> in chess (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1476793.1476819">Zobrist, 1969</a>), and due in large part to the rules of Go that scarely describe how 9 &#215; 9 Go is best played.</p>

          <h3><a href="#">5 Tips to Get Better at 9 &#215; 9 Go</a></h3>
          <span class="category"><a href="#">Learning Methodology</a></span> </div>
        <p>First, knowing Go rules is essential but not enough to make you get better at 9 &#215; 9 Go. The rules do not describe how Go is best played. They just describe the objects of the game, how Go stones are placed, captured, and made safe, how the game ends, how White's disadvantange of playing second is compensated, and how the final scores are determined. They do not describe how to find the best moves.</p>  
		
		<p>Second, you should develop your skill, by playing thousands of 9x9 Go games online or offline, where there is a stronger opponent. Observe the moves that made you fail and the ones that made you win. Note also that a majority of your moves are not the best ones, and your kyu Go mindset can be a major obstacle that prevents you from breakthrough to Shodan. You will need to unlearn the way to Go, and relearn the better way to 9 &#215; 9 Go.</p> 
		
		<p>Third, you no longer need to go to human Go masters for instruction. Consult a real Go master, a verified Go AI that has already achieved superhuman performance and topped the chart of a standard online Go server. The verified Go AI should be comparable to KataTest (9 Dan) in superhuman performance&#8212;capable of becoming No. 1 top ranked player on Go Quest.</p> 
		
		<p>Fourth, have your games analyzed by the versified Go AI, for best move detection and correct situation analysis. Do not try to copy the AI moves. Try to make understanding of why the best moves are there, and formulate the principles of 9 &#215; 9 Go to describe and explain the best moves, which can be applied to your games in the future.</p>
	      
		<p>Fifth, make proverbs to describe the principles of 9 &#215; 9 Go, to remind you how 9 &#215; 9 Go should be played. The proverbs should be accompanied by diagrams and detailed simple descriptions, or you will forget what your proverbs really mean. If you can't explain the principles of 9 &#215; 9 Go simply, with your proverbs and the accompanying materials, you don't understand them well enough. The proverbs that cannot be falsified by others will remain reliable proverbs.</p>

          <h3><a href="#">Introduction to WGA Verified Go AI</a></h3>
          <span class="category"><a href="#">Superhuman</a></span> </div>
        <p>WGA verified Go AI is the moblie application called A Master of Go, with KataGo engine and the b18nbt neural network that has achieved superhuman performance in 9 &#215; 9 Go. The AI won (2:0) against the old KataGo that topped the charts of human Go servers in 2019, after achieving a 8-Dan ranking on Go Quest, and can predict the next moves of <a href="http://wars.fm/go9#user/katatest">KataTest 9 Dan</a>, with about 95% accuracy. The 5% wrong predictions were the cases where the AI's predicted moves cause higher net scores than the actual moves of KataTest did. The verified AI exploits KataGo which is superhuman at or above 128 visits per move, according to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00241">Wang et al. (2023)</a>.
		
	      <p><a href="https://new3rs.github.io/a_master_of_go/index.html">A Master of Go</a> is a brillant Go AI developed by Yuji Ichikawa, available from <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/%E5%9B%B2%E7%A2%81%E3%81%AE%E5%B8%AB%E5%8C%A0/id1442035374">App Store</a>. This AI is credited as the co-author of the advanced 9 &#215; 9 Go e-book, <i> Principles of 9 &#215; 9 Go</i> and being the principal game analyst for this project. 
		<p>This project is not possible without the hard works of many computer Go scientists. Dated back to 1969, or 54 years ago, Albert L. Zobrist, a Ph.D. student at University of Wisconsin, published his paper on the first Go playing program that played Go against Mr. George Cowan, an undergraduate student at the same university, who had five game experience at the time of the contest. The program has a record of two wins and two losses against this opponent. The program was intended to solve one big problem of Go: People were able to play Go without knowing how they were able to play so well (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1476793.1476819">Zobrist, 1969</a>)   
			
		<p>Since then, many scientists were working to apply algorithms to Go bots and wished to claim them the strongest Go program in the world, by winning a gold medal at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Olympiad">Computer Olympiads</a>.
			
		<p>In 2008, David Silver, a Ph.D. student at University of Alberta, co-applied two algorithms (heuristic UCT and UCT–RAVE) to the program MoGo. Then, MoGo achieved 3 Dan (strong master level) in 9 × 9 Go games against human players on the Kiseido Go Server; became the highest rated program on both 9 × 9 and 19 × 19 Computer Go servers; won the gold medal at the 2007 Computer Go Olympiad; and became the first program to beat a human professional player at 9 × 9 Go (<a href="https://www.davidsilver.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/master-level-go.pdf">Gelly and Silver, 2000</a>). In 2013, he joined DeepMind to lead the AlphaGo project, making AlphaGo the first program to beat a top 9 Dan Professional Go player (Lee Sedol 9p). AlphaGo uses the tree search to evaluate positions and uses deep neural networks to select moves. These neural networks were trained by supervised learning from human expert moves. He then led the development of AlphaGo Zero that learn Go by reinforcement learning from self-play, without human data input except the game rules. AlphaGo Zero achieved superhuman performance (beyond 9p), wining 100-0 against the previously published, champion-defeating AlphaGo. The source code of AlphaGo Zero is unpublished, but the program is introduced in  (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24270.epdf?author_access_token=VJXbVjaSHxFoctQQ4p2k4tRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0PVW4gB86EEpGqTRDtpIz-2rmo8-KG06gqVobU5NSCFeHILHcVFUeMsbvwS-lxjqQGg98faovwjxeTUgZAUMnRQ">Silver et al., 2017</a>)

		<p>Then, it was in 2018. American scientist David J. Wu of MIT started <a href="https://github.com/lightvector/GoNN">a personal experimentation in Go neural net training and Go AI</a>. He improved the AlphaZero process and architecture, to build open-source bot KataGo, with trained neural network (b20c256), that defeated superhuman ELF (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.04522.pdf">Tien, 2019</a>;<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.10565.pdf"> Wu, 2019</a>).  
According to the <a href="https://github.com/lightvector/KataGo/blob/master/TrainingHistory.md">KataGo Training History and Research</a>, on 9x9 (KataGo's same networks can handle all common board sizes), KataGo topped the CGOS ladder in May 2020 using one V100 GPU, playing more than 100 games against other top bots including many specially-trained 9x9 bots, as well as many games against moderately weaker 9x9 bots. Against the strongest several opponents, it won close to half of these games, while losing only one game ever (the rest of the games were draws). An alternate version configured to be more aggressive and/or even to deliberately overplay won more than half of its games against the strongest opponents, drawing slightly less often at the cost of losing a few additional games. 
	  
	  	<p>In addition, KataGo (20b9_335 on RTX 2060) topped the chart of Go Quest 9 x 9 Go server (+92-0=1; R = 2761), and was promoted to 9 Dan by the server, known as <a href="http://wars.fm/go9#user/katatest">KataTest 9 Dan</a>, the only invincible No. 1 top ranked players on Go Quest. 

		<p>In 2019, Japanese scientist Yuji Ichikawa applied KataGo engine and the famous neural networks to his iOS app called A Master of Go. The recent version (v6.0.1, March 29, 2023, Kata1_b18nbts550), running on iPhone, can top the chart of Go Quest, by the transitive law. This version defeated the previous version that topped the chart of Go Quest in 2019 (2 : 0) at or below 100 visits per move. A Master of Go has been promoted to 9p+ by WGA and assisted in game analysis for this Mini Go Review project since April 2023. The app will be credited as coauthor of WGA’s e-books on 9 x 9 Go.

The losing games, due to the adversarial policies or any other causes, were not used for studying, so that the AI's inherent weakness will never affect the proverb quality.
