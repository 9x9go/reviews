White is me, placing stones for A Master of Go 9p+, a superhuman player.];B[fd]C[The best moves in 9 x 9 Go is on the fourth line. This opening exploits the middle path strategy, being neither too territorial nor too influential. Black played Hoshi, among the best first moves, as it is both territorial and influential.];W[df]C[The only best response to Hoshi is the Hoshi that diagonally jumps twice from Black’s Hoshi, to share equal land.];B[de]C[Too early? No. This is the best move. The attack is supported by Black 1. In a high komi game, Black needs to attack White as soon as possible. The best attack is to jump from the base stone like the marked black stone.]TR[fd];W[ce]C[White hit back the contact move, from the safer side. This move serves three purposes: to weaken the marked black stone, to protect the left bottom corner, and to support White’s attack on the top left corner. However, the best move is on A. White plans to invade the East.]LB[cf:A]TR[de];B[gf]C[This move is too territorial and very bad one. The urgent task is to block White on A. Now, White can attack Black on B to protect the West, and want to fix the shape on C.]LB[cd:A][dd:B];W[dd]C[White does as planed.];B[ee]C[A must.];W[cd]C[Fix the shape before attacking more.]
;B[dc]C[Don’t touch an opponent’s strong group like this move. It can easily be cut with a white stone on A.]LB[ec:A];W[ec]LB[ed:A]C[Although Black will cut on A, White will be able to capture the marked stone with ease.]TR[dc];B[ed]C[The best thing Black can do is to cut like this. Otherwise, White will make the next move on this point instead. Now, White is winning by 5 points. You need to develop an ability to count the score long before the endgame, when the territories of both players are still very obscure.];W[db]C[Now the whole left top corner has become White’s territory, which is larger than Black’s territory on the bottom right corner, where White can easily invade by extending from the marked white stone.]TR[df];B[cg]C[Powerless. Black 13 will help White fix the shape on A. If Black will help the marked stone, White will enjoy attacking both black groups by fighting along the fourth line.]LB[cf:A]TR[cg];W[cf]C[More will be reviewed.];B[gg];W[fc]
