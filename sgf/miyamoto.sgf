The black stones are abbreviated by the letter “Bx,” where x is the move number, and the white stones are abbreviated by the letter “Wy,” where y the the move number. For example, B1 is the black stone for move 1, and W2 the white stone for move 2.];B[de]C[In this game, komi is zero, so Black has a natural advantage of playing first. He made the first move on D5, to control the territory on the left.];W[fe]C[W2 is a balance move. Balance is always a good opening-strategy for White. So, W2 was played at F5. White wanted to control the territory on the right.];B[ee]LB[ec:A][eg:B]C[Black prevented White from playing more balance moves, by destroying the symmetry with B3 at E5.
However, this was the first bad move. Black can neither reduce White’s territory nor expand his territory. Either A or B is better, which both develops Black’s territory and destroys White’s territory.];W[fd]C[W4 creates a good wall to protect White’s territory on the right.];B[ff]C[B5 pushed White rightward and protected the bottom left corner, which looks larger than White’s territory in the top right corner.];W[gf]C[W6 is a must. Otherwise, Black will play here and control the large territory in the bottom zone.];B[gg]C[B7 was not intended to capture the triangle marked stone, but to be sacrificed, in exchange of the large territory in the the left bottom corner. However, the circled marked group were far from the edge and prone to be invaded. Black must conduct some local fight to have more black stones placed closer to the edge.]TR[gf]CR[de][ee][ff];W[fg]MA[gg]C[W8 is a must, aiming at killing the X marked stone. This White’s attack is to strengthen the white group and to defend the territory on the right, as the proverb says “Attack is the best defense.”]
;B[ef]MA[ff]C[B9 is a must. It is too big to let White kill the X marked stone. If the marked stone were captured, the white group would be good in shape, being hard to capture, able to expand White’s territory with ease, and weaken the adjacent black stones.];W[gh]LB[hg:A][he:B][dc:C][be:D]C[A is better, bigger than W10 by 2 points. If W10 were on A, then the best sequence is G2-B-C-D. Black would not be able to control the large territory in the upper zone.];B[hg]MA[gg]C[B11 was a must. It was too big to let the marked stone get killed. White had controlled Black’s responsive moves for two consecutive turns.];W[hh]LB[fh:A][ge:B]MA[gf]C[W12 was not played at A because Black would attack the marked stone on B, and destroy White’s territory on the right, and would create the two weak white groups.];B[eg]C[It’s time for Black to control White’s moves. White couldn’t ignore Black’s attack. He need to play local responsive moves.];W[fh]C[Black wanted to further control White’s moves, by playing at the points to which White must respond locally. The goal is to conceal the white stones in the left side and to develop a large territory in the upper zone at the same time.];B[ge]MA[ge][gg][hg]LB[hf:A]TR[gf]C[First, Black planned to sacrifice the X marked stones, in exchange of the territory. in the upper zone. White needed to help the triangle marked white stone.];W[hf]MA[ge]C[W16 is a must, which also weakened the X marked stone.]
;B[he]MA[ge]TR[fd][fe]C[Black pretended to help the X marked stone. But, the real purpose was to make a forceful attack on the triangle marked white stones in the future.];W[ig]MA[ge][he]C[To control the opponent’s moves in his or her mind is as important as to control the territory on the board. Strong players are willing to let some of their stones die in other to limit the opponent’s next-move options. Black played the X marked stones in order to control White’s next moves subsequently.];B[fc]LB[ed:A][gc:B]C[Let’s how Black control White. If White makes the next move on A, Black will happily extend on B, to control the big top right corner.];W[gd]C[White wanted to invade the large free land on the left, but it was more urgent to help the X marked stones. So, White played the triangle marked stone.]MA[fd][fe]TR[gd];B[gc]C[This move is not intend to capture the triangle marked stones, but to protect the territory in the top zone, while forcing White to make the next move on A.]TR[fd][fe][gd]LB[hd:A];W[hd]C[Black wanted to confine the triangle marked stones, by closing on A, which is not the best move.]LB[ed:A]TR[fe][fd][gd][hd];B[ed]LB[dc:A]C[B23 should be at A instead, because it will both block the triangle marked stones and better guard against White’s invasion on the top left corner.]TR[fe][fd][gd][hd];W[be]LB[cd:A][cb:B]C[A is better than B5, as it forces Black to protect the top area by playing a defensive move on B; White will destroy more territory of Black.]
;B[hc]LB[bc:A][bd:B]C[Black wanted to make a move on A but he attacked the marked group first, expecting White to capture the X marked stones to protect the triangle marked white stones. However, attacking the triangle marked group like this is not urgent at all. Black would better attack the circle marked stone on B first, forcing White to help this weak stone while protecting Black’s territory in the top region..]MA[ge][he]TR[fe][fd][gd][hd]CR[be];W[ie]C[Black built the solid wall as marked, which protects the top zone. Now, he wanted to deal with the circle marked stone, by pushing it southwards.]SQ[fc][gc][hc]CR[be];B[bc]LB[bd:A][cd:B][bc:C][ce:D][cc:E][ch:F]C[Making the contact move on A is much better; the best-move sequence will be A to F, which protects more Black’s territory in the top zone.];W[cg]LB[bd:A][cc:B]C[This White’s move is too defensive, allowing Black to hit the circle marked stone at A.  In stead, placing W28 at A is better, forcing Black to help the triangle marked stone with an extension at B, which takes place deeper into Black’s territory. ]TR[bc]CR[be];B[cf]C[B29 is a thank-you move, which is bad. White will thankfully link his group at A. Black’s hitting at B is a better attack, which both protects to top zone and pushes the triangle marked stone southwards.]LB[bf:A][bd:B]TR[be];W[bf]C[Black wanted to occupy more White’s spaces in the bottom zone, by separating the white group on the left from that on the right.];B[ch]C[Black expected the best-move sequence from A to H. The left side had become a major war field because the white group on the right cannot be killed. Black tried to attack the weak white group on the left, by using the influence (extending) from the strong black group.]LB[bh:A][dh:B][cc:C][cd:D][bd:E][cb:F][dc:G][bb:H];W[cc]C[White knew the weakness of the triangle marked stone which is the weakest stone on the board. W32 tried to cut the path between the triangle marked stone and the black group.]TR[bc]
;B[cb]C[B33 is too receptive and overly safe, expecting the best-move sequence from A to C. Making the contact move on A is better.]LB[cd:A][dc:B][bh:C];W[dg]LB[cd:A]C[W34 is White’s big mistake. He could defeated Black by more than 7 points if he placed W34 at A (71% win rate for the best move at A vs 9% win rate for the actual move at D3). We can check which move is very bad or very good by reading the situation graph. If the value for the estimated net score of Black sharply increase right after White makes a move, then it is a very bad move of White.];B[dh];W[bh];B[eh];W[dc]LB[cd:A];B[bd];W[ec]
