(;SZ[9]AP[A Master of Go:6.0.1]GN[A001]EV[Komi Deciding Match]RO[1]PB[Miyamoto Naoki]BR[8p]PW[Go Seigen]WR[9p]KM[0]DT[1968]PC[Japan]RE[B+4]RU[Japanese]SO[www.9x9go.org]AN[Monteo da Westi]CP[© 2023 Monteo da Westi]C[In this review, when referring to a stone, the abbreviation is always capitalized followed by the move number. The black stones are abbreviated by the letter Bx, where x is the move number, and the white stones are abbreviated by the letter Wy, where y the the move number. For example, B1 is the black stone for move 1, and W2 the white stone for move 2.];B[de]C[
The komi of this game was zero. So, Black had a natural advantage of playing first. He made the first move at D5, to control the territory on the left.];W[fe]C[
W2 is a balance move. Balance is always a good opening-strategy for White. So, W2 was played at F5. White wanted to control the territory on the right.];B[ee]LB[ec:A][eg:B]C[Black prevented White from playing more balance moves, by destroying the symmetry with move 3 at E5. However, this was the first bad move. Black could neither reduce White's territory nor expand his territory. Either A or B is better, which both develops Black's territory and destroys White's territory.];W[fd]C[
W4 created a good little wall to protect White's territory on the right.];B[ff]C[
B5 pushed White rightward and protected the bottom left corner, which looks larger than White's territory in the top right corner but the three black stones were far from the edge; White will be able to invade the left bottom corner if Black is not well prepared.];W[gf]C[W6 is a must. Otherwise, Black will play at G4 and control the large territory in the bottom zone.];B[gg]TR[gf]CR[de][ee][ff]C[
B7 was not intended to capture the triangle marked stone, but to be sacrificed, in exchange of the large territory in the the left bottom corner. Black realized that the circled marked group were still far from the edge and prone to be invaded. Black must conduct some local fight to place more black stones closer to the edge.];W[fg]MA[gg]C[
W8 is a must, aiming at killing the X marked stone. This White’s attack is to strengthen the white group and to defend the territory on the right, reminding us of the proverb: Attack is the best defense.];B[ef]MA[ff]C[B9 is a must. It is too big to let White kill the X marked stone. If the marked stone were captured, the white group would be good in shape, being hard to capture, able to expand White's territory with ease, and weaken the adjacent black stones.];W[gh]LB[hg:A][he:B][dc:C][be:D]C[
A is better and bigger than W10. If W10 were at A, then the best sequence should be G2-B-C-D. Black would not be able to control the large territory in the upper zone.];B[hg]MA[gg]C[
B11 was a must. It was too big to let the X marked stone get killed. White had controlled Black's responsive moves for two consecutive turns.];W[hh]LB[fh:A][ge:B]MA[gf]C[W12 was not played at A because Black would attack the X marked stone at B, and would destroy White's territory on the right, as well as create the two weak white groups.];B[eg]C[
Since B13, it's time for Black to control White's moves. White couldn't ignore Black's attack. He needed to play responsive moves locally.];W[fh]C[
After W14, Black wanted to further control White's moves, by playing at the points to which White must respond locally. The goals were to conceal the white stones in the area on the right, and to develop a large territory in the upper zone at the same time.];B[ge]MA[ge][gg][hg]LB[hf:A]TR[gf]C[First, Black planned to sacrifice the X marked stones, in exchange of the territory in the upper zone. White needed to help the triangle marked white stone by extending at A.];W[hf]MA[ge]C[
W16 was a must, which also weakened the X marked stone.];B[he]MA[ge]TR[fd][fe]LB[ig:B]C[
B17 pretended to help the X marked stone. But, the real purpose was to make a forceful attack on the triangle marked white stones in the near future. This is "Make a sound in the East, then strike the West."

White had to capture at B.];W[ig]MA[ge][he]C[In 9 x 9 Go, to control the opponent's next moves in his or her mind is as important as to control the territory on the board. Strong players are willing to let some of their stones die in other to limit the opponent's next-move options. Black placed the X marked stones in order to control White's next moves subsequently.];B[fc]LB[ed:A][gc:B]MA[fd][fe]C[
B19 controlled White's next moves which will save the X marked stones. If White played at A, Black will happily extend at B, to both attack the adjacent white stones and defend the top right corner.];W[gd]MA[fd][fe]TR[gd]C[
White wanted to invade the large free land on the left, but it was more urgent to help the X marked stones. So, White placed the triangle marked stone.];B[gc]TR[fd][fe][gd]LB[hd:A]C[B21 was not intended to capture the triangle marked stones, but to protect the territory in the top zone, by forcing White to make the next move at A.];W[hd]TR[fe][fd][gd][hd]LB[ed:B]C[
Black wanted to seal the triangle marked stones at B, which is not the best move.];B[ed]TR[fe][fd][gd][hd]LB[dc:C]C[
B23 should be at C instead, because it will guard against both the triangle marked stones and any invading white stones on the top left corner.

From the whole board perspective, White saw a lot of vacant points on the left side of the board, which attracted White's invasion.];W[be]LB[cd:A][cb:B]C[Playing at A is better than W24, as it forces Black to protect the top area by placing a defensive black stone at B; White will destroy more territories of Black in the top region.];B[hc]MA[ge][he]TR[fe][fd][gd][hd]CR[be]LB[bc:C][bd:D][id:E]C[
Black wanted to attack the circle marked stone at C but he attacked the triangle marked group first, expecting White to capture the X marked stones at E to protect the triangle marked white stones. However, attacking the triangle marked group like this is not urgent at all. Black would better attack the circle marked stone at D first, forcing White to help this weak stone while protecting Black's territory in the top region.];W[ie]SQ[fc][gc][hc]CR[be]C[
The square marked stones formed a solid wall, which well protects Black's territory in the top zone. Now, Black wanted to deal with the circle marked white stone, by pushing it southwards.];B[bc]LB[bd:A][cd:B][bc:C][ce:D][cc:E][ch:F]C[B27 at B7 was too defensive. Making the contact move at A is much better; the best-move sequence will be A to F, which protects more Black's territories in the top zone.];W[cg]TR[bc]CR[be]LB[bd:G][cc:H]C[
W28 was also too defensive, allowing Black to hit the circle marked stone at G. Instead, placing W28 at G is better, forcing Black to help the triangle marked stone with an extension at H, which takes place deeper into Black's territory. G is the key point for both players. The proverb says the enemy's key point is your ket point.];B[cf]TR[be]LB[bf:J][bd:K]C[
B29 is a thank-you move and a bad peep. White will thankfully link his stones at J. B29 at K is a better attack, which both protects the top zone and pushes the triangle marked stone southwards.];W[bf]C[Black wanted to destroy more White's spaces in the bottom zone, by separating the white string on the left from the white group on the right.];B[ch]LB[bh:A][dh:B][cc:C][cd:D][bd:E][cb:F][dc:G][bb:H]C[
With B31, Black expected the best-move sequence from A to H. The left side of the board had become a major battle field because the white group on the right can never be killed. Black tried to attack the weak white group on the left, by extending from the strong black group.];W[cc]TR[bc]C[
White knew the weakness of the triangle marked black stone which is the weakest stone on the board. W32 tried to cut the path between the triangle marked stone and the black group on the right.];B[cb]LB[cd:A][dc:B][bh:C]C[B33 was too defensive and an overly safe play, expecting the best-move sequence from W34 at A to B35 at C. Making the contact move at A is better for B33.];W[dg]LB[cd:D]C[
W34 was White's big mistake. He could defeated Black if he placed W34 at D instead (71% win rate for the best move at D vs 9% win rate for the actual move at D3). We can check which move is very bad or very good by reading the situation graph. For example, if the value for the estimated net score for Black sharply increases at move 34, then that White's move is a very bad.];B[dh]TR[ch][dh]MA[cg][dg]LB[eh:E][bg:F]C[
White couldn't cut at E because Black can protect the triangle marked stones at F, to kill the X marked stones.  Black successfully cut the white stones into two groups.];W[bh]LB[eh:A]TR[ch][dh]C[W36 defended the white group and forced Black to play at A, to save the two marked black stones.];B[eh]LB[bi:B][bd:C]C[
The white group on the left is still a weak group. Playing at B is too defensive, which allows Black to press at C. So, White must be more aggressive by attacking Black.];W[dc]TR[cc][dc]LB[db:E][bd:F]C[
Black's extending at E was rather reactive and not the best move. Extending at F is proactive and the best move, which weakens the triangle marked white group.];B[bd]TR[cc][dc]LB[cd:A][ce:B]C[The marked white group was most vulnerable to capture. Playing at A couldn't do any help, as Black would block at B.

The triangle marked white stones seemed hopeless. But White planed to save them.];W[ec]LB[cd:C]C[
W40 divided the black stones into two groups. The big black group in the middle zone was not yet well formed and being surrounded by the three white groups. Black needed to protect it while attacking the two white groups on the left. Playing at C is the best next move.];B[cd]TR[cc][dc][ec]C[
White needed to save the triangle marked weak white group.];W[fb]TR[fc][gc][hc]LB[gb:A][eb:B]C[The triangle marked black group was attacked by W42. Black's next move at A will fix its shape and create White's weak point at B.];B[gb]LB[eb:C][ga:D]C[
If White play at C, Black will play at D, the triangle marked white group will be vulnerable to capture.]TR[cc][dc][ec][fb];W[bb]TR[cc][dc][ec][fb]CR[fc][gc][hc][gb]C[
White needed to increase the liberties of the triangle marked white group.];B[eb]TR[eb][fc][gc][gb][hc]MA[fb][ec][dc][cc]C[Black destroyed the X marked white group and made the triangle marked black stones good in shape.];W[db]LB[fa:A]C[
B47 was perfect at A, to make this black group closer to immortaity.];B[fa]LB[ca:A]TR[bb][cc][dc][ec][db]C[
White also needed a good shape for the triangle marked white group. 

So, W48 at A was perfect.

Black and white stones in the top zone still had weekness in shape, which needed to be fixed before playing somewhere else.

White started making a good shape by playing W48 at A.];W[ca]LB[ea:A][da:B]TR[bb][ca][db][cc][dc][ec]CR[eb][fa][fc][gc][gb][hc]C[The marked circle stones black were not yet perfect in shape, as the opposing player can prevent them from having two-eyes. Black wanted to make sure the circle marked black stones will permanently live. B49 at A is perfect, as it is proactive and forces White to protect the marked white group at B.];B[ea]LB[da:B]C[
The top black group was now strong, while the adjacent white group was still vulnerable to capture. White, too, needed to strengthen the group at B.];W[da]LB[df:C][ab:D]C[
Black wanted to make sure that the big black group in the middle is safe. So, he played at C instead of D.];B[df]LB[bg:A]C[White needed to play at A. Otherwise, the whole white group in the middle region will collapse.];W[bg]C[
Black believed the upper white group cannot survive. He didn't hurry to play at A.  He wanted to make sure that the lower big black group was safe by playing at B.]LB[bi:B][ab:B];B[bi]LB[ab:C]MA[be][bf][bg][bh][cg][dg]C[
White had three groups on the board, two of which were still vulnerable to capture. The lower left group was the weakest and hopeless. So, White wanted to save the upper white group by playing at C, and then attack the lower black group, by exploiting the influence of the X marked dead white stones. The proverb says dead stones are hopeless but can be helpful.];W[ab]TR[be][bf][bg][bh][cg][dg]LB[ah:A]C[Black wanted to kill the marked white group as soon as possible; he played move 55 at A.];B[ah]LB[ci:B]C[
B55 hurried attached the white stone. In fact, B is the proper place for move 55.];W[ci]LB[di:C]C[
White was keen enough to see the key point at W56. He expected Black to capture W56 at C.

There were three weak groups on the board. Board reading skill is crucial. It was a matter of life and death.];B[di]LB[ag:A]C[White continued to control Black's moves. He tried to kill more Black's space, by playing the next move at A.];W[ag]TR[be][bf][bg][ag][bh][cg][dg]LB[ae:B]C[
Black needed to reduce the liberties of the marked white group, so he played the next move at B.];B[ae]LB[ac:C]C[
Black and white stones in the lower left zone were all weak. Both players tried to capture the opposing stones by killing their liberties. First, White had invaded Black's territory. 

Now it's time to attack the weak black group from the outside. 

C was the best location for White's next move.];W[ac]C[Black needed to block at A. Otherwise the whole black group on the left will die.]LB[ad:A];B[ad]MA[be][bf][bg][bh][ag][cg][dg]LB[dd:B][ha:C][ga:D]C[
White didn't further attack from the outside at B, because the X marked white group will get killed eventually. He wanted to make Black concern of the circle marked black group by invading at C, to peep Black's weak point at D.]CR[ea][eb][fa][fc][gc][gb][hc];W[ha]LB[ga:E][fb:F][hb:G]MA[ea][eb][fa][gb][gc][hc][fc]C[
Black couldn't ignore W62. The X marked black group can be captured if White were allowed to play at E, Black at F and White at G. Black had to prevent this capture by playing at G.];B[hb]LB[fi:A]C[Now, it was the endgame. White had to protect his territory and gradually occupy Black's territory. White wanted to play at A, and then to squeeze the black group on the left.];W[fi]MA[be][bf][bg][bh][ag][cg][dg]LB[ce:B][ai:C]C[
Black needed to kill the X marked white group before the big black group will get killed. So, Black wanted to reduce the liberties of the X marked white group at B, to force White to capture at C.];B[ce]LB[ai:C]C[
C was the only choice for W66.

Territories and liberties counting became vital in the endgame.

Black was clearly leading.];W[ai]LB[ci:A][ah:B]C[Black wanted to play at A, which can later capture the marked white stone at B.]MA[ai];B[ci]C[
White had to attack from the outside, at C.]LB[ei:C];W[ei]LB[ah:D]C[
Playing at D was the only choice for B69.];B[ah]LB[af:A][ai:B][ic:C]MA[ag][bg][bh][bf][be][cg][dg]CR[ea][eb][fa][fc][gc][hc][hb][gb]TR[ha]C[The X marked white group can be killed at A. White needed a bigger Ko, before capturing at B. So, White wanted to play at C, to kill the circle marked black group, by exploiting the influcence of the triangle marked white stone.];W[ic]LB[ib:A]C[
Black couldn't ignore W70. 

Playing B71 at A was perfect.

This game is a good example of Ko fight.

There were fewer weak points in White's shape than in Black's shape.];B[ib]LB[ai:A]C[
White could return to capture at A.];W[ai]LB[ba:A][dd:B][cb:C]C[Black needed a powerful attack. A is perfect. If White will play at B, Black will capture the circle marked white stones at C.]CR[ca][da][db][cc][dc][ec];B[ba]LB[aa:D]C[
White had to deal with B73, by simply capturing it at D.];W[aa]LB[ah:E]C[
Black can return to capture at E.];B[ah]LB[ga:A]MA[eb][ea][fa]C[White needed another powerful attack. It was at A, to kill the X marked black stones.];W[ga]LB[ia:B]C[
Capturing at B was a must for B77.];B[ia]MA[ea][fa][eb][ic]LB[ai:C][ga:D][id:E]C[
White could return to capture at C.

Although the circle marked black group had two eyes, it was not perfectly safe, as there existed a capturing point at D.

White could still attack at D, to kill the three X marked black stones.

Black could only attack at E, to kill just the X marked white stone.];W[ai]LB[ga:A][ah:B][af:C]MA[ai][bh][ag][bg][cg][dg][bf][be]C[Black wanted to end the Ko fight, by fixing the shape at A. Then, he will be able to capture at B and C without Ko. He knew that the X marked white group was already dead.];B[ga]MA[be][bf][bg][cg][dg][bh][ag][ai]LB[id:B]C[
White, too, knew the X marked stones were hopeless. So, he played at move 80 B. Both players passed after W80. The game ended immediately.];W[id]MA[ai][ag][bg][bh][cg][dg][bf][be]LB[dd:C][ah:D][af:E]C[
This game was played in Japan and probably under Japanese rules. So, Black didn't capture the X marked dead white stones, as the addition of black stones on the board will reduce Black's score. Black wins by 5 points at this state. However, if White continued at C, Black had to play at D and E.; Black will win by 4 points under Japanese rules. Under Chinese rules, on the contary, the addition of stones doesn't affect the score; Black wins by 5 points even if the game continued for another three moves (C-D-E).
