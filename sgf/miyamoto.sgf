The black stones are abbreviated by the letter “Bx,” where x is the move number, and the white stones are abbreviated by the letter “Wy,” where y the the move number. For example, B1 is the black stone for move 1, and W2 the white stone for move 2.];B[de]C[The komi of this game was zero. So, Black had a natural advantage of playing first. He made the first move at D5, to control the territory on the left.];W[fe]C[W2 is a balance move. Balance is always a good opening-strategy for White. So, W2 was played at F5. White wanted to control the territory on the right.];B[ee]LB[ec:A][eg:B]C[Black prevented White from playing more balance moves, by destroying the symmetry with move 3 at E5. However, this was the first bad move. Black can neither reduce White’s territory nor expand his territory. Either A or B is better, which both develops Black’s territory and destroys White’s territory.];W[fd]C[W4 creates a good wall to protect White’s territory on the right.];B[ff]C[Black pushed White rightward and protected the bottom left corner, which looks larger than White’s territory in the top right corner but the three black stones were far from the edge; White will be able to invade the left bottom corner if Black is not well prepared.];W[gf]C[W6 is a must. Otherwise, Black will play at G4 and control the large territory in the bottom zone.];B[gg]C[B7 was not intended to capture the triangle marked stone, but to be sacrificed, in exchange of the large territory in the the left bottom corner. Black realized that the circled marked group were still far from the edge and prone to be invaded. Black must conduct some local fight to place more black stones closer to the edge.]TR[gf]CR[de][ee][ff];W[fg]MA[gg]C[W8 is a must, aiming at killing the X marked stone. This White’s attack is to strengthen the white group and to defend the territory on the right, reminding us of the proverb: “Attack is the best defense.”]
;B[ef]MA[ff]C[B9 is a must. It is too big to let White kill the X marked stone. If the marked stone were captured, the white group would be good in shape, being hard to capture, able to expand White’s territory with ease, and weaken the adjacent black stones.];W[gh]LB[hg:A][he:B][dc:C][be:D]C[A is better, bigger than W10 by 2 points. If W10 were on A, then the best sequence is G2-B-C-D. Black would not be able to control the large territory in the upper zone.];B[hg]MA[gg]C[B11 was a must. It was too big to let the X marked stone get killed. White had controlled Black’s responsive moves for two consecutive turns.];W[hh]LB[fh:A][ge:B]MA[gf]C[W12 was not played at A because Black would attack the X marked stone at B, and would destroy White’s territory on the right, as well as create the two weak white groups.];B[eg]C[It’s time for Black to control White’s moves. White couldn’t ignore Black’s attack. He needed to play responsive moves locally.];W[fh]C[Black wanted to further control White’s moves, by playing at the points to which White must respond locally. The goals were to conceal the white stones in the area on the right, and to develop a large territory in the upper zone at the same time.];B[ge]MA[ge][gg][hg]LB[hf:A]TR[gf]C[First, Black planned to sacrifice the X marked stones, in exchange of the territory in the upper zone. White needed to help the triangle marked white stone.];W[hf]MA[ge]C[W16 is a must, which also weakened the X marked stone.]
;B[he]MA[ge]TR[fd][fe]C[Black pretended to help the X marked stone. But, the real purpose was to make a forceful attack on the triangle marked white stones in the near future. This is “Make a sound in the East, then strike the West.”];W[ig]MA[ge][he]C[To control the opponent’s next moves in his or her mind is as important as to control the territory on the board. Strong players are willing to let some of their stones die in other to limit the opponent’s next-move options. Black played the X marked stones in order to control White’s next moves subsequently.];B[fc]LB[ed:A][gc:B]C[Let’s see how Black control White’s moves. If White made the next move at A, Black would happily extend at B, to control the big top right corner.];W[gd]C[White wanted to invade the large free land on the left, but it was more urgent to help the X marked stones. So, White played the triangle marked stone.]MA[fd][fe]TR[gd];B[gc]C[This move was not intend to capture the triangle marked stones, but to protect the territory in the top zone, by forcing White to make the next move at A.]TR[fd][fe][gd]LB[hd:A];W[hd]C[Black wanted to seal the triangle marked stones at A, which is not the best move.]LB[ed:A]TR[fe][fd][gd][hd];B[ed]LB[dc:A]C[B23 should be at A instead, because it will guard against both the triangle marked stones and any invading white stones on the top left corner.]TR[fe][fd][gd][hd];W[be]LB[cd:A][cb:B]C[Playing at A is better, as it forces Black to protect the top area by placing a defensive black stone at B; White will destroy more territories of Black in the top region.]
;B[hc]LB[bc:A][bd:B]C[Black wanted to make a move on A but he attacked the triangle marked group first, expecting White to capture the X marked stones to protect the triangle marked white stones. However, attacking the triangle marked group like this is not urgent at all. Black would better attack the circle marked stone at B first, forcing White to help this weak stone while protecting Black’s territory in the top region.]MA[ge][he]TR[fe][fd][gd][hd]CR[be];W[ie]C[Black built the solid wall as marked, which protects Black’s territory in the top zone. Now, Black wanted to deal with the circle marked stone, by pushing it southwards.]SQ[fc][gc][hc]CR[be];B[bc]LB[bd:A][cd:B][bc:C][ce:D][cc:E][ch:F]C[This Black’s move is too defensive. Making the contact move on A is much better; the best-move sequence will be A to F, which can protect more Black’s territories in the top zone.];W[cg]LB[bd:A][cc:B]C[This White’s move is also too defensive, allowing Black to hit the circle marked stone at A.  In stead, placing W28 at A is better, forcing Black to help the triangle marked stone with an extension at B, which takes place deeper into Black’s territory. ]TR[bc]CR[be];B[cf]C[B29 is a thank-you move and a bad peep. White will thankfully link his stones at A. Black’s hitting at B is a better attack, which both protects to top zone and pushes the triangle marked stone southwards. ]LB[bf:A][bd:B]TR[be];W[bf]C[Black wanted to destroy more White’s spaces in the bottom zone, by separating the white string on the left from the white group on the right.];B[ch]C[Black expected the best-move sequence from A to H. The left side of the board had become a major war field because the white group on the right can never be killed. Black tried to attack the weak white group on the left, by using the influence (extending) from the strong black group.]LB[bh:A][dh:B][cc:C][cd:D][bd:E][cb:F][dc:G][bb:H];W[cc]C[White knew the weakness of the triangle marked stone which is the weakest stone on the board. W32 tried to cut the path between the triangle marked stone and the black group.]TR[bc]
;B[cb]C[B33 is too receptive and overly safe, expecting the best-move sequence from W34 at A to B35 at C. Making the contact move at A is a better place for B33.]LB[cd:A][dc:B][bh:C];W[dg]LB[cd:A]C[W34 is White’s big mistake. He could defeated Black if he placed W34 at A instead (71% win rate for the best move at A vs 9% win rate for the actual move at D3). We can check which move is very bad or very good by reading the situation graph shown above. For example, if the value for the estimated net score for Black sharply increases at move 34, then that move is a very bad White’ s move.];B[dh]LB[eh:A][bg:B]C[White cannot cut at A because Black can protect the triangle marked stones at B, to kill the X marked stones.  Black successfully cut the white stones into two groups.]TR[ch][dh]MA[cg][dg];W[bh]C[W36 defends the white group and forces Black to play at A, to save the two marked stones.]LB[eh:A]TR[ch][dh];B[eh]C[The white group on the left is still a weak group. Playing at A is too defensive, which allows Black to press at B. So, White must be more aggressive by attacking Black.]LB[bi:A][bd:B];W[dc]LB[db:A][bd:B]C[Black’s extending at A is reactive and not the best move. Extending at B is proactive and the best move, which weaken the marked group.]TR[cc][dc];B[bd]TR[cc][dc]C[The marked white group is most vulnerable to capture. Playing at A cannot help, as Black will block at B.]LB[cd:A][ce:B];W[ec]C[The big black group in the middle was not well formed and being surrounded by three white groups. Black needed to protect it while attacking the two white groups on the left. Playing at A is the best next move.]LB[cd:A]
;B[cd]TR[cc][dc][ec]C[White needed to deal with the marked weak white group.];W[fb]TR[fc][gc][hc]C[The marked black group was attacked. Playing at A will fix its shape and create White’s weak point at B.]LB[gb:A][eb:B];B[gb]LB[eb:A][ga:B]C[If White play at A, Black will play at B, the marked white group will be vulnerable to capture.];W[bb]C[White needed to increase liberties of the marked white group, to kill the marked black group.]TR[cc][dc][ec][fb]CR[fc][gc][hc][gb];B[eb]C[Black destroyed the X marked white group and made the marked stones in good shape.]TR[eb][fc][gc][gb][hc]MA[fb][ec][dc][cc];W[db]LB[fa:A]C[Playing at A is perfect, to make this black group immortal.];B[fa]LB[ca:A]C[White also needed a good shape for the marked white group. So, playing at A s perfect.]TR[bb][cc][dc][ec][db];W[ca]C[The marked stones were not yet perfect in shape, as the opposing player can prevent them from having two-eyes. Black wanted to make sure the circle marked black stones will permanently live. Playing at A is perfect, as it is proactive and forces White to protect the marked white group at B.]LB[ea:A][da:B]TR[bb][ca][db][cc][dc][ec]CR[eb][fa][fc][gc][gb][hc]
;B[ea]C[The top black group was now strong, while the adjacent white group was still vulnerable to capture. White needed to strengthen the group at A.]LB[da:A];W[da]C[Black wanted to make sure that the big black group is safe. So, he played at A instead of B.]LB[df:A][ab:B];B[df]LB[bg:A]C[White needed to play at A. Otherwise, the whole white group on the right will collapse.];W[bg]LB[ab:A][bi:B]C[Black believed the upper white group cannot survive. He didn’t hurry to play at A.  He wanted to make sure that the lower big black group was safe by playing at B.];B[bi]C[White had three groups on the board, two of which were vulnerable to capture. The lower left group is very weak and hopeless. So, White wanted to help the upper white group by playing at A, and then will attack the lower black group.]LB[ab:A];W[ab]C[Black wanted to kill the marked white group as soon as possible. ]TR[be][bf][bg][bh][cg][dg]LB[ah:A];B[ah]C[Black hurried to play at A2. In fact, playing at A is better.]LB[ci:A];W[ci]C[White was keen enough to see the weak point at C1, where he played move 56, expecting Black to capture it at A.]LB[di:A]
;B[di]C[White continued to control Black’s moves. He tried to kill more Black ‘s space, by playing the next move at A.]LB[ag:A];W[ag]C[Black needed to reduce the liberties of the marked white group, so he played the next move at A.]LB[ae:A]TR[be][bf][bg][ag][bh][cg][dg];B[ae]C[Stones in the lower left zone were all weak. Both players tried to kill the opposing stones by killing their liberties. First, White tried to invade inside Black’s territory. Now it was time to attacked the black group from outside in. Playing at A is perfect for White’s next move.]LB[ac:A];W[ac]C[Black needed to block at A. Otherwise the whole black group on the left will die.]LB[ad:A];B[ad]LB[dd:A][ha:B]C[White didn’t further attack from outside in at A, as the lower white group will get killed eventually. He wanted to make Black concern of the upper black group by invading at B.];W[ha]LB[ga:A][fb:B][hb:C]C[Black couldn’t ignore this attack. The upper black group can be captured if White were allowed to start the move sequence of A-B-C. Black had to prevent at C.];B[hb]C[Now, they entered the endgame. White had to protect his territory and gradually reduce Black’s territory. White wanted to play at A, and then to squeeze the black group on the left.]LB[fi:A];W[fi]C[Black needed to kill the marked white group before the big black group will get killed. So, Black wanted to reduce the liberties of the marked white group at A, which forces White to capture at B.]MA[be][bf][bg][bh][ag][cg][dg]LB[ce:A][ai:B]
;B[ce]LB[ai:A]C[A is the only choice for White.];W[ai]LB[ci:A][ah:B]C[Black wanted to play at A, which can later capture the marked white stone at B.]MA[ai];B[ci]LB[ei:A]C[White had to attack from outside in at A.];W[ei]LB[ah:A]C[Playing at A is the only choice for Black.];B[ah]LB[af:A][ai:B][ic:C]MA[ag][bg][bh][bf][be][cg][dg]C[The marked white group can be killed at A. White needed Ko, in order to capture at B. So, White wanted to play at C, to kill the upper black group.];W[ic]LB[ib:A]C[Black couldn’t ignore the marked white stone. Playing at A is perfect.]TR[ic];B[ib]LB[ai:A]C[White can capture at A.];W[ai]C[Black needed a powerful attack. A is perfect. If White will play at B, Black will capture at C.]LB[ba:A][dd:B][cb:C]
