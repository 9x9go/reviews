The black stones are abbreviated by the letter “Bx,” where x is the move number, and the white stones are abbreviated by the letter “Wy,” where y the the move number. For example, B1 is the black stone for move 1, and W2 the white stone for move 2.];B[de]C[The komi of this game is zero. Black wanted to control the western zone.];W[fe]C[A balance move is always a good opening strategy for White. White wanted to control the eastern zone.];B[ee]LB[ec:A][eg:B]C[B3 was the first bad move for Black, which can neither reduce White’s territory nor expand Black’s territory. Either A or B is better, which both develops Black’s territory and destroys White’s territory.];W[fd]C[W4 creates a good wall that defends the East.];B[ff]C[B5 was for pushing White and protecting the bottom zone.];W[gf]C[W6 is a must. Otherwise, Black will play here and control the large bottom area.];B[gg]C[B7 is to be sacrificed, in exchange of the bigger left bottom territory.];W[fg]MA[gg]C[W8 is a must, aiming at killing the X marked black stone.]
;B[ef]MA[ff]C[B9 is a must. It is too big to let White kill the X marked black stone.];W[gh]LB[hg:A][he:B][dc:C][be:D]C[A is better, bigger than W10 by 2 points. If W10 were on A, then the best sequence is G2-B-C-D. Black would not be able to control the large area in the top zone.];B[hg]MA[gg]C[B11 is a must. It was too big to let the marked stone get killed.];W[hh]LB[fh:A][ge:B]MA[gf]C[W12 is not on A because Black would attack the marked stone on B.];B[eg];W[fh];B[ge]MA[ge][gg][hg]LB[hf:A]TR[gf]C[Black planned to sacrifice the X marked stones, in exchange of the northern territory. White needed to help the triangle marked white stone.];W[hf]MA[ge]C[W16 is a must, which also weakened the X marked stone.]
;B[he]MA[ge]TR[fd][fe]C[Black pretended to help the X marked stone. The real purpose was to make a forceful attack on the triangle marked white stones in the future.];W[ig]MA[ge][he]C[To control the opponent’s moves in his or her head is as important as to control the stones and spaces on the board. Strong players are willing to let some of their stones die in other to limit the opponent’s next-move options. Black placed the X marked stones in order to control White’s next moves.];B[fc]LB[ed:A][gc:B]C[If White will make the next move on A, Black will happily extend on B, to control the big top right corner.];W[gd]C[What wanted to invade the large free land on the left, but it is more urgent to help the X marked stones with the triangle marked stone.]MA[fd][fe]TR[gd];B[gc]C[This move is not intend to capture the triangle marked stones, but to protect the territory in the northern region, while forcing White to make the next move on A.]TR[fd][fe][gd]LB[hd:A];W[hd]C[Black wanted to confine the triangle marked stones, by closing on A, which is not the best move.]LB[ed:A]TR[fe][fd][gd][hd];B[ed]LB[dc:A]C[B23 on A is better, because it will both block the triangle marked stones and better guard against White’s invasion on the top left corner.]TR[fe][fd][gd][hd];W[be]LB[cd:A][cb:B]C[A is better, as it forces Black to protect the top zone be playing a defensive move on B; White will destroy more of Black’s territory.]
;B[hc]LB[bc:A][bd:B]C[Black wanted to make a move on A but he attacked the marked group first, expecting White will have to kill the X marked stones to protect the triangle marked white stones. However, attacking the triangle marked group is not urgent at all. Black would better attack the circle marked stone on B first, forcing White to help this weak white stone while protecting Black’s territory in the northern region.]MA[ge][he]TR[fe][fd][gd][hd];W[ie]C[Black built the solid wall as marked, which protects the top zone. Now, he wanted to deal with the circle marked stone, by pushing it southwards.]SQ[fc][gc][hc]CR[be];B[bc]LB[bd:A][cd:B][bc:C][ce:D][cc:E][ch:F]C[Making the contact move on A is much better; the best-move sequence will be A to F, which protect more Black’s spaces in the top zone.];W[cg]LB[bd:A][cc:B]C[This White’s move is too defensive, allowing Black to hit the circle marked stone on A.  In stead, placing B27 on A is better, forcing Black to help the triangle marked stone with an extension on B, which takes place deeper into Black’s territory. ]TR[bc];B[cf]C[B29 is a thank-you move, which is bad. White will thankfully link his group on A. Hitting on B is a better attack, which both protects to top zone and pushes the triangle marked stone southwards.]LB[bf:A][bd:B]TR[be];W[bf]C[Black wanted to kill more White’s spaces in the bottom zone, by blocking the white stones on the left and those on the right.];B[ch]C[Black expect the best-move sequence from A to H.]LB[bh:A][dh:B][cc:C][cd:D][bd:E][cb:F][dc:G][bb:H];W[cc]C[White knew the weakness of the triangle marked stone.]TR[bc]
;B[cb]C[B33 is too receptive and overly safe, expecting the best-move sequence from A to C. Making the contact move on A is better.]LB[cd:A][dc:B][bh:C];W[dg]LB[cd:A]C[W23 is White’s big mistake. He could defeated Black by more than 7 points if he placed W34 on A (71% win rate for the best move on A vs 9% win rate for the actual move on D3).];B[dh];W[bh];B[eh];W[dc]LB[cd:A];B[bd];W[ec]
