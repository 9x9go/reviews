Mini Go Reviews is WGA's project to develop the principles of 9 x 9 Go, in terms of Go proverbs. The project was run by Monteo da Westi 2d assisted in game analysis by superhuman Go AI, called A Master of Go 9p+ (or AMG), version 6.0.1, iOS Go app developed by Yuki Ichikawa. AMG exploits KataGo engine and the verified neural network (b18nbts550), which can top the ranking chart of Go Quest, based on the transitive laws and the AMG's game results in March 2023. This project contributes to Go community by solving this problem: Top players were able play 9 x 9 Go so well without describing their effective strategy and efficient tactics as verbal algorithms in the SGF codes.
