# Introduction
9 x 9 Go Reviews is WGA's 9 x 9 Go classroom, to learn how the game of 9 x 9 is best played. Study notes on principles, proverbs, and analyzed 9 Dan professional games were made by [Monteo da Westi](http://wars.fm/go9#user/monteodawesti), J. K. Pon, and [A Master of Go](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/a-master-of-go/id1442035374), 9p+ (or AMG, version 6.0.1). AMG, employed with kind permission from Yuji Ichikawa, exploits KataGo engine (v1.12.4) and the verified neural network ([the strongest confidently-rated network: kata1-b18c384nbt-s5503060480-d3193512631](https://katagotraining.org/networks/kata1/), as of April 2, 2023), of which the older engine with the weaker neural network, [KataTest 9 Dan](http://wars.fm/go9#user/katatest) topped the chart of Go Quest 9 x 9 Go server in Septermber 2019. AMG can top the chart as well, based on the transitive laws and the AMG's game results in March 2023. The Reviews on iOS devices is at [9 x 9 Go Reviews](https://9x9go.github.io/reviews).
