# A Study Note on 9 x 9 Go
## 9 x 9 Go Rules
The rules of 9 x 9 Go describes what Go players are allowed to do when playing Go on 9 x 9 board.

## 9 x 9 Go Proverbs
9 x 9 Go proverbs are phrases or sentences that give advices on how 9 x 9 Go is best played, or say things that are generally true about the winning strategy and tactics exploited by A Master of Go, 9p+ and the 9 Dan professional Go players who played 9 x 9 Go. We focus on the best moves that were both played by the top 9 Dan professional Go player and selected by the superhuman Go player. Such moves can be considered the most certainly real best moves which show that the game was being best played.

- __The proper komi is 7__, based on the premises that all 9 Dan professional players except Yuki Satoshi were defeated by other 9 Dan professional Go players, when having white stones under 6.5 Komi, implying that Komi being 6.5 is too small and gives Black advantage, and that the initial win rates of Black and White were most equal under 7 komi, compared with those under 6.5 and 7 komi.
- __Tengen is not the best first move for Black__. Move 1 on Tengen is popular among legendary players, including Go Seigen 9p and Cho Hunhyun 9p, as well as superhuman [KataGo](https://katagotraining.org). Tengen has been recommended as the only best first move in a high komi game (>7), where Black needs to be very aggressive. However, it is not the top three best first moves for Black after move 17. See [Experiment 1](https://github.com/9x9go/reviews/blob/main/README.md#experiment-1)
- __The enemy key point is your key point__. A common key point is a point where the enemy wants to occupy to save his or her group while you want to occupy it to kill that group or vice versa. This kind of key points is known as a vital point.
- __Kill spaces, not stones__. Capturing a big group of stones can be achieved by killing the enemy's space, which is more effective when the enemy is unconcious of the global attack on his or her space than when the enemy is concious of the local attack on his or her stones.
- __Nearly dead stones are hopeless but can be helpful__. These stones are hard to rescue but they can support your invasion, with skillful manoeuvres, deeper into the enemy's torritories.
- __Empty triangles are not always bad__. Sometimes, the empty triangle turns out to be a must and the best move.

__Hypothesis 1__: _Yuki Satoshi is the strongest human 9 x 9 Go player_. He was the only one who, when having white stones with komi being 6.5, can beat a 9 Dan professional player at least once. He defeated Iyama Yuta 9p who, when being young, defeated Ohashi Hirofumi 6p who is said to be spaceman 9d who used to be one of the top five players on Go Quest 9 x 9 Go server. Yuki Satoshi also did the longest consecutive wins (20 games) in the Yomiuri TV's MiniGo One Game Match event, after which the event terminated. Besides, having black stones, he defeated more than one of the 9 Dan professional Go players.  

__Hypothesis 2__: _Komi being 6.5 is too small in 9 x 9 Go, and 5.5 is not a proper komi at all_. Most 9 x9 Go players (9p) in the Yomiuri TV's MiniGo event were defeated under this komi size. A proper komi can be determined by observing the 0-komi 9 x9 Go game results when Black and White are AIs with perfectly equal superhuman performance (AI self-play, run on the same device and the same number of visits per move). We found Black almost always won by 6.3 - 7.5 points (99% CI), and the mean wining score is 6.9 points. This may explain why Komi being 7 is under Go Quest and WGA standards.   

## Human Performance
A player's Elo rating shows his or her winning potential, not his or her game quality. A player still takes points from the lossing opponent, no matter how the rated game was poorly played by the winner.

We used another method, called superhuman performance analysis, to assess a player's performance, to check how well each game was played by the player, in terms of %best move (percentage of moves played by the player that agree with thoses recommended as the best moves by superhuman A Master of Go 9p+) and the mean net drop in the player's opponent's win rate due to the player's previous move (D). If D is negative, the player's moves are mainly weaker than the superhuman's moves by D% difference. If D is zero, then the player's moves are as strong as superhuman's. If D is positive, then the player's moves are divine moves which are stronger than superhuman's moves.

__Hypothesis 3__:

## Game Report
Game results have long been reported as win or lost by time, by resignation or by certain points, which do not reflect the playing quality in that game. Game quality analysis must be performed by a superhuman player that is much stronger than the players whose game is being analyized. Below is an example of game results report that are more informative, based on the actual game data analysis.

|Parameters          |        Black |       White|
|:-------------------|-------------:|:-----------|
|Player              |Miyamoto Naoki|   Go Seigen|
|Rank                |            8p|          9p|
|Total Move          |	           40|          40|
|Total Best-Move     |       	    32|    	     35|
|%Best Move          |	           80|          88|
|%Mean Move-Strength |         97.36|	      97.55|
|Worst-Move Dif      |	        -28.2|    	    -38|
|Worst-Move Number   |	           27|          34|
|Divine Moves        |	            0|           0|

__Discussions__
1.  Although Go Seigen was defeated, he made more best moves and each of his moves was mainly stronger. If Komi were 7, Go Seigen can win by 3 points. Clearly, Go Seigen is slightly stronger than Miyamoto Naoki in 9 x 9 Go.
2. Miyamoto Naoki was only slightly weaker, in terms of both %Best Move and Mean Move Strength. He deserved 9p, which he actually achieved the next year.
3. In this game, both players's move quality can be graded as A, based on the following criterea:

| %Best Move | Grade |
|:-----:|:----:|
|90 - 100|A+|
|80 - 89|A|
|70 - 79|B|
|60 - 69|C|
|50 - 59|D|
|40 - 49|E|
|30 - 39|F|
|20 - 29|G|
|10 - 19|H|
|0 - 9|J|

__Validation__
To check if the above grading model can work properly or not, we conducted a reality check. The model must pass the following tests:
1. Crazy Stone 5D must have lower %Best Move and lower move strength than both Go Seigen and Miyamoto Naoki.
2. A novice player must have lower %Best Move and lower move strength than all of the above players.
3. Yuki Satoshi 9p and Iyama Yuta 9p must have higher %Best Move and higher Move Strength than Crazy Stone 5D, and comparable to Go Seigen and Miyamoto Naoki.

# Experiments
To develop the principles of 9 x 9 Go, one researcher played the game of 9 x 9 Go for about 10,000 games in 23 years (one game per day on average), and played the game for A Master of Go on Go Quest for another 113 games, topping the chart of Go Quest in 2020. We found that KataGo with Lizzie and A Master of Go, an iOS application, were equivalent in performance on 9 x 9 board, when the same neural networks were used. The mobile version defeated the PC version when the neural networks of the former were stronger. Currently, we conducted computer experiments to study 9 x 9 Go from move 1 to move n.

## Experiment 1
### Question 1:
What is the best first move for Black on 9 x 9 board?
#### Hypotheses:
[The best first move for Black is Tengen](https://9x9go.github.io/reviews/pdf/EX1.pdf)
### Results
After move 17 in A Master of Go's self-play games (>300 visits per move), White's win rates dropped as follows:
|First Move  | White's win rate at move 17|
|:-----------|:------:|
|Hoshi|47|
|Komoku|48|
|Takamoku|55|
|Tengen|63|
|Moku-hazushi|70|
|Sansan|74|

Hoshi, Komoku, and Takamoku were the top three best first moves for Black. Hoshi was the best one, which agrees with the best first moves in the [9 Dan professional players' games](https://github.com/9x9go/reviews#9-x-9-go-big-matches):
|First Move  | Win| Lost|%Win|
|:-----------|:------:|:----:|----:|
|Hoshi|2|0|100|
|Takamoku|2|0|100|
|Komoku|1|0|100|
|Tengen|2|2|50|

Surprisingly, Tengen was not the best first move for Black in 9 x 9 Go.
