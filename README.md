# 9 x 9 Go Reviews
9 x 9 Go Reviews is the first WGA's project to develop the principles of 9 x 9 Go, in terms of Go proverbs with accompanying diagrams and detailed descriptions. The project was run by [Monteo da Westi](http://wars.fm/go9#user/monteodawesti), J. K. Pon, and [A Master of Go](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/a-master-of-go/id1442035374), 9p+ (or AMG, version 6.0.1), with kind permission from Yuji Ichikawa. AMG exploits KataGo engine (v1.12.4) and the verified neural network ([the strongest confidently-rated network: kata1-b18c384nbt-s5503060480-d3193512631](https://katagotraining.org/networks/kata1/), as of April 2, 2023), of which the older engine with the weaker neural network, [KataTest 9 Dan](http://wars.fm/go9#user/katatest) topped the chart of Go Quest 9 x 9 Go server in Septermber 2019. AMG can top the chart as well, based on the transitive laws and the AMG's game results in March 2023. This project exploits AMG to solve this problem: Top players were able play 9 x 9 Go so well without describing their effective strategy and efficient tacticse. Project results are given below and on iOS devices at [9 x 9 Go Reviews](https://9x9go.github.io/reviews).
