9 x 9 Go Reviews is the first WGA's project to develop the principles of 9 x 9 Go, in terms of Go proverbs with accompanying diagrams and detailed descriptions. The project was run by Monteo da Westi and Jay K. Pon, assisted by superhuman A Master of Go 9p+ (or AMG), version 6.0.1, with kind permission from Yuji Ichikawa. AMG exploits KataGo engine and the verified neural network (b18nbts550), which can top the ranking chart of Go Quest, based on the transitive laws and the AMG's game results in March 2023. This project contributes to Go community by solving this problem: Top players were able play 9 x 9 Go so well without describing their effective strategy and efficient tactics as verbal algorithms in the SGF codes.
