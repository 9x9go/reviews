# Introduction
9 x 9 Go Reviews is a 9 x 9 Go experiment, to determine how the game of 9 x 9 is best played. Study notes include facts, hypotheses, theorems, theories, laws, and proverbs synthesized as Principles of 9 x 9 Go, learned from the 9 Dan professional players' and superhuman players' games, by [Monteo da Westi](http://wars.fm/go9#user/monteodawesti), J. K. Pon, and [A Master of Go](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/a-master-of-go/id1442035374), 9p+ (or AMG, version 6.0.1). AMG, employed with kind permission from Yuji Ichikawa, exploits KataGo engine (v1.12.4) and the verified neural network ([the strongest confidently-rated network: kata1-b18c384nbt-s5503060480-d3193512631](https://katagotraining.org/networks/kata1/), as of April 2, 2023), of which the older engine with the weaker neural network, [KataTest 9 Dan](http://wars.fm/go9#user/katatest) topped the chart of Go Quest 9 x 9 Go server in Septermber 2019. AMG can top the chart as well, based on the transitive laws and the AMG's game results in March 2023. The Reviews on iOS devices is at [9 x 9 Go Reviews](https://9x9go.github.io/reviews).

# Principles of 9 x 9 Go
## 9 x 9 Go Principles
Principles of 9 x 9 Go explain how the game of 9 x 9 Go is actually played. 
1. [The rules of 9 x 9 Go](https://9x9go.github.io/reviews/pdf/P001.pdf)

## 9 x 9 Go Proverbs
9 x 9 Go proverbs are phrases or sentences that give advices on how 9 x 9 Go is best played, or say things that are generally true about the winning strategy and tactics exploited by A Master of Go, 9p+ and the 9 Dan professional Go players who played 9 x 9 Go. We focus on the best moves that were both played by the top 9 Dan professional Go player and selected by the superhuman Go player. Such moves can be considered the most certainly real best moves which show that the game was being best played.

- __The proper komi is 7__, based on the premises that all 9 Dan professional players except Yuki Satoshi were defeated by other 9 Dan professional Go players, when having white stones under 6.5 Komi, implying that Komi being 6.5 is too small and gives Black advantage, and that the initial win rates of Black and White were most equal under 7 komi, compared with those under 6.5 and 7 komi.
- __Tengen is the best opening__. Move 1 on Tengen is popular among legendary players, including Go Seigen 9p and many No.1 ranked players on Go Quest, as well as superhuman [KataGo](https://katagotraining.org). Tengen is also the only best move in a high komi game (>7), where Black needs to be very aggressive.
- __The enemy key point is your key point__. A common key point is a point where the enemy wants to occupy to save his or her group while you want to occupy it to kill that group or vice versa. This kind of key points is known as a vital point.
- __Kill spaces, not stones__. Capturing a big group of stones can be achieved by killing the enemy's space, which is more effective when the enemy is unconcious of the global attack on his or her space than when the enemy is concious of the local attack on his or her stones.
- __Nearly dead stones are hopeless but can be helpful__. These stones are hard to rescue but they can support your invasion, with skillful manoeuvres, deeper into the enemy's torritories.
- __Empty triangles are not always bad__. Sometimes, the empty triangle turns out to be a must and the best move.

## 9 x 9 Go Big Matches
Below are the selected 9 Dan professional players' 9 x 9 Go game records and the comments by A Master of Go, 9p+. Grey shading marks the winner of each game. The original and more SGF files are given on AEB's [9 x 9 Go page](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~aeb/go/games/games/other_sizes/index.html).

__Hypothesis 1__: _Yuki Satoshi is the strongest human 9 x 9 Go player_. He was the only one who, when having white stones with komi being 6.5, can beat a 9 Dan professional player at least once. He defeated Iyama Yuta 9p who, when being young, defeated Ohashi Hirofumi 6p who is said to be spaceman 9d who used to be one of the top five players on Go Quest 9 x 9 Go server. Yuki Satoshi also did the longest consecutive wins (20 games) in the Yomiuri TV's MiniGo One Game Match event, after which the event terminated. Besides, having black stones, he defeated more than one of the 9 Dan professional Go players.  

__Hypothesis 2__: _Komi being 6.5 is too small in 9 x 9 Go, and 5.5 is not a proper komi at all_. Most 9 x9 Go players (9p) in the Yomiuri TV's MiniGo event were defeated under this komi size. A proper komi can be determined by observing the 0-komi 9 x9 Go game results when Black and White are AIs with perfectly equal superhuman performance (AI self-play, run on the same device and the same number of visits per move). We found Black almost always won by 6.3 - 7.5 points (99% CI), and the mean wining score is 6.9 points. This may explain why Komi being 7 is under Go Quest and WGA standards.   

## Human 9 x 9 Go performance* 
Elo rating shows Go players' performance based on the final results of multiple games. A player still gains positive Elo score when they win a game, no matter how each game is poorly played.

WGA is developing a new approach to measure the actual performance of each Go player in a given game, in terms of %best-move agreement (0 - 100% best moves played) and avarage net move-impact on the opponent's win rate per move (i). If i is negative, the player's moves are mainly weaker than the superhuman's moves by i% difference. If i is zero, then the player's moves are as strong as superhuman. If i is positive, then the player's moves are mainly divine moves (or stronger superhuman).

__Hypothesis 3__:

| %Best Move | Mean Difference in Move Impact     | Ranks     |                 Player | Side | Year | Fieldbook |
