# 9 x 9 Go Reviews
9 x 9 Go Reviews is the first WGA's project to develop the principles of 9 x 9 Go, in terms of Go proverbs with accompanying diagrams and detailed descriptions. The project was run by [Monteo da Westi](http://wars.fm/go9#user/monteodawesti), J. K. Pon, and [A Master of Go](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/a-master-of-go/id1442035374), 9p+ (or AMG, version 6.0.1), with kind permission from Yuji Ichikawa. AMG exploits KataGo engine (v1.12.4) and the verified neural network ([the strongest confidently-rated network: kata1-b18c384nbt-s5503060480-d3193512631](https://katagotraining.org/networks/kata1/), as of April 2, 2023), of which the older engine and neural network, [KataTest 9 Dan](http://wars.fm/go9#user/katatest) topped the ranking chart of Go Quest in Septermber 2019. AMG can top the chart as well, based on the transitive laws and the AMG's game results in March 2023. This project was intended to solve this problem: Top players were able play 9 x 9 Go so well without describing their effective strategy and efficient tactics as algorithms in the SGF codes. Project results can also be viewed with an iOS device at [9 x 9 Go Reviews](https://9x9go.github.io/reviews).
